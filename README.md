# Graphics

Homework and base code for graphics programming class at Stuyvesant High School

Note to Mr. DW, due to my current implementation, my coordinate planes are
reversed, as a result, your mdl scripts may not work or will render sideways.

Path configuration:
```
. ./env
```

Features Implemented:
  - Backface culling
  - Scanline conversion (buggy)
  - z-depth buffering (buggy)
